# Three.js App

## Starting the app

- Navigate to threejayes root directory
- Install dependencies
- run the command `npm run dev`
- Navigate to the address provided

## What is it

- Just a small app showcasing a bit of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to render a 3d object, and [Greensock(gsap)](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for animating it. The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OwJV2xL8M8). Upon starting the app you should see a lit, 3d sphere. You can interact with lighting and color by holding left mouse button and dragging. You can change the location of the sphere on the page by holding right click and dragging.
- The file `main.js` is where all the three.js and greensock magic happens. I’ve left shoddy comments in my code vaguely outlining how the stuff works.

## Why I did it

- I don’t know I like learning cool stuff and I’ve been playing with blender lately.
